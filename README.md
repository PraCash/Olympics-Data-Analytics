# Olympics Data Analytics
 Azure end to end data engineering project for Tokyo Olympics 2021

Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering solution using Azure services. Weâ€™ll ingest raw data from Kaggle, transform it, and analyze the results. The project flow includes the following steps:

Data Source: Obtain raw data from Kaggle (e.g., Kaggle datasets related to Tokyo Olympics).
Data Integration: Use Azure Data Factory to ingest and integrate the data.
Raw Data Store: Store the integrated data in Azure Data Lake Gen 2.
Transformation: Utilize Azure Databricks for data transformation.
Transformed Data Storage: Store the transformed data back into Azure Data Lake Gen 2.
Analytics: Implement Azure Synapse Analytics for data analysis.
Dashboard: Visualize insights using tools like Looker Studio , PowerBi and Tableau.
